ðŸŒŸ Excited to share my first data analysis project! ðŸŒŸ

I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize sales performance for a company. The dashboard was built to answer critical business questions such as:
ðŸ”¹ Which retailer contributes the most to sales?
ðŸ”¹ What are the top-performing products across regions?
ðŸ”¹ How does the sales method impact total revenue and operating profit?
ðŸ”¹ Which cities and states drive the highest sales volumes?

The process included:
ðŸ”¸ Data preprocessing: Using Excel and Python to clean and filter the dataset, focusing on key attributes such as Retailer, City, Product, Sales Method, and Operating Profit.
ðŸ”¸ Data visualization: Crafting a dashboard in Power BI to present insights in a clear, actionable format for stakeholders.

This project reinforced my understanding of data cleaning, visual storytelling, and how to derive meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making.

Looking forward to your thoughts and connecting with fellow data enthusiasts! ðŸš€
